This is because our native birds, bats, lizards and invertebrates evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, and do not have the correct behaviours or breeding strategies to cope with the level of predation they inflict.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that for North Island brown kiwi, Rowi, Haast tokoeka, and Fiordland tokoeka (these are all species of kiwi) 95% of chicks born in the wild each year do not survive and 50% of these deaths can be attributed to predation by stoats and feral cats. Although kiwi are long lived, this level of predation is unsustainable with kiwi populations declining by 3% annually. Without stoat control, kiwi could be lost from the wild within two generations. Stoat predation is believed to be the main reason for the loss of almost half the wild takahe population in Fiordland in 2007. Stoats are also culprits in the decline of kaka, mohua, whio (blue duck), rock wren and numerous other native birds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to birds, stoats prey on lizards and can have localized impacts on their populations. Stoats are also known to eat large numbers of native invertebrates such as weta, but the extent to which this is impacting weta populations is not well studied.\r\n\r\nStoats are excellent tree climbers and swimmers, therefore animals nesting up a tree or on islands, within 1.5 km from shore, are not safe from stoats.  Young female stoats are impregnated before they leave the nest they were born in, so even one female stoat can start a new population.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nStoats are a potential vector of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in New Zealand, although the prevalence of TB is low in stoats.\r\n', 'There are a number of traps available for controlling stoats.

Their ecological impacts are largely unknown.  Their greatest impact is suspected to be competition with native lizards for resources including food and habitat. Plague skinks prey on invertebrates and are very good at settling in and making a home in almost any kind of habitat. They are excellent stowaways and have established populations on several offshore islands in Auckland’s Hauraki Gulf, which are home to many native lizard species no longer present on the mainland. Plague skinks on these islands will not only be competitors but may pose additional risk by passing on diseases from the mainland that the native lizards have not come into contact with.\r\n\r\nPlague skink populations reach very high densities, providing a food resource for mammalian predators such as rats, hedgehogs, mustelids and feral cats. A good food supply may lead to increased numbers of those predators which, in turn, may increase the risk of native species being killed.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nPlague skinks tend to thrive in urban areas.  As their populations have increased, more and more people in cities such as Auckland have reported plague skinks entering their homes and taking up residence. This poses a potential risk to human health, as lizards are known to be carriers of diseases including salmonella and cryptosporidium.\r\n', 'Control methods for plague skinks in NZ include checking belongings when moving from infested areas, using traps for live capture, and legal compliance, as they are classified as an Unwanted Organism.

Prints are very small and can look like scattered dots.\r\n', 'Ecological impacts\r\nLike all rodent species present in New Zealand, house mice are omnivorous and get their dietary requirements from a wide range of sources. They feed on plant and animal material, and have very flexible feeding behaviour to take advantage of whatever food sources become available. Plant food is usually seeds, but green parts are also eaten. Invertebrates (including insects and spiders) are usually the main species eaten, but bird eggs and chicks and lizards may also be consumed.\r\n\r\nThe broad diet of mice means that their impacts are equally broad and can be observed through the entire ecosystem. They can affect nutrient cycling within ecosystems by eating the insect larvae that break down leaf litter, therefore preventing the nutrients in the leaf litter returning to the soil. Selective predation of certain seeds can prevent regeneration and alter forest plant species composition. Mice have been recorded feeding on inanga eggs in estuaries, which could have an impact on whitebait runs. On Gough Island in the sub-Antarctic, mice have learned that petrel and albatross chicks are a good food source and they start eating chicks that are still alive.\r\n\r\nMice are a key food source for stoats and feral cats in the New Zealand bush. When conditions are right and there is plenty of food, mouse numbers can increase rapidly. This can occur both in beech forest systems and in tussock grasslandsand results in population growth of mouse predators. These predators feed on native species as well as mice, and during high predator years predation on native birds increases dramatically and can cause local population collapse.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nMice frequently invade houses and damage many things they come into contact with, either by urinating or defecating on it, eating it, chewing it, or a combination of all of these activities.\r\n', ' mouse control methods include using traps, bait stations, and certain toxins, adhering to the Animal Welfare Act 1999 which mandates humane treatment of caught animals.

Generally slightly oval and pointed.\r\n', ' Four toes show on front and rear feet. Rear feet are much longer than front feet.\r\n', 'Ecological impacts\r\nThe direct ecological impacts of rabbits are related to their feeding and burrowing behaviour. The impacts of rabbit feeding behaviour are very similar to those of other grazing animals such as sheep, deer and goats. Varying combinations of these animals have been present in many areas where impact studies have taken place, making it difficult to distinguish the effects of one species from another. As might be expected from a herbivorous species, rabbits can have significant negative impacts on native plant species. Grazing can lead to favoured plant species becoming restricted to areas where rabbits can’t access. Rabbits can cause changes in vegetation composition, as the species that rabbits don’t like to eat are left behind while the tasty ones are removed. Weeds can also become more common as rabbits open up gaps in pasture or native vegetation. Rabbit burrowing behaviour speeds soil erosion, which further damages habitat for native flora and can affect water quality.\r\n\r\nSecondary impacts of rabbits are related to their role as a favoured food source for feral cats and ferrets. As rabbit populations decline, predator populations also decline, but some predators disperse to new areas and survivors may switch to feeding on native prey instead of rabbits.\r\n\r\nRabbits can be confused with hares. The most telling differences are; hares are much bigger and heavier, have longer ears with a black tip, tawny fur, and yellow eyes, and lope with their tail down.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nRabbits are a significant agricultural pest throughout their introduced range and New Zealand is no exception. They compete with livestock for food and it has been estimated that the economic loss caused by rabbits in productive agricultural areas is around $1.10 to $2.10 per rabbit per stock unit carried. The overall economic impact of rabbits is difficult to quantify, but estimates are in the range of tens of millions of dollars per annum upwards. Rabbit burrows can injure livestock if their legs become trapped. Ferrets are one of the main vectors of bovine Tb and their populations are sustained through feeding on rabbits - this leads to an increased level of disease risk at that location. Rabbits will damage trees and shrubs by feeding on shoots or on the bark of larger trees. Rabbits eat seedlings and strip tender leaves from established vegetable crops.\r\n', 'Contact your local Department of Conservation or Regional Council office for advice (see Next Steps).  Poisoning using pindone, shooting, and fumigation of warrens have all been used. 1080 is widely and more commonly used than pindone to poison rabbits because it is substantially cheaper per hectare.

Tahr grazing can limit the distribution and abundance of iconic plant species such as the Mount Cook buttercup. Tahr are highly gregarious (unlike other ungulates in the alpine areas of New Zealand) and can reach high densities so that, in addition to grazing damage, large groups of tahr can damage alpine vegetation by trampling.

Fallow deer are selective browsers, concentrating their feeding on plant species they prefer to eat. In some areas of native forest this can lead to a change in plant composition. Fallow deer can reach high densities in parts of New Zealand. These densities remain high despite managed hunting ballots. When fallow deer are at high density they can prevent regeneration of the tree species whose seedlings and saplings they prefer to eat. They readily graze introduced grasses, but can also thrive in native forest where these species are scarce,\r\n\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nLike red deer, fallow deer may act as a spillover host for bovine tuberculosis (i.e. TB is more likely to be found in fallow deer which inhabit areas where the possums have TB and are at high densities).

During the breeding season they also aggressively protect their nests and chase indigenous bird species away. In the South Island the species mostly breeds along riverbeds and adjacent to high country lakes and could potentially be affecting the health of indigenous riparian habitat, if present, through grazing and trampling.  Canada geese may contribute to the introduction of new weeds to riparian areas by transporting seeds in their droppings or caught on feathers.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nCanada geese damage agricultural grasslands and may also damage crops such as turnips, cereal crops and peas, although this is not commonly reported. Several studies have tried to quantify the amount of pasture they eat, including one estimate that four geese ate the equivalent amount of grass as one stock unit. Damage to pasture is variable around the country and depends on the number of geese using the area, which may in turn vary according to weather and climate conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was mainly due to these impacts, that, in 2011, Canada goose was listed as an unprotected species in New Zealand, replacing its previous classification as a game bird managed by Fish and Game New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe geese also foul pasture, and other areas, with droppings which may carry diseases such as avian influenza, campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and salmonella, some of which could be passed to stock (although this has not been proven).

They primarily eat invertebrates, potentially impacting some native species; however, they also eat large numbers of introduced invertebrate pests. Consequently, in addition to being a pest in some areas, magpies are probably also important because they eat a lot of agricultural invertebrate pests.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nMagpies will attack humans who venture near nests during the breeding season. It has been reported that magpies peck at power-line fittings, sometimes causing lines to short circuit.  Electrocuted birds have been blamed for starting fires after catching alight and falling into dry vegetation below.\r\n', 'Australian magpies are intelligent birds and quickly learn from experience, which can make them very difficult to eradicate.

The extent of rooting can be quite severe, and in some areas where numbers of feral pigs are high, they can uproot most of the ground surface, as well as lower stature vegetation. This can affect the forest ecosystem because plants and invertebrates (such as earthworms) are being eaten. Pigs can also compete for food with native animals and pig rooting could damage kiwi feeding areas. Soil disturbance can encourage regeneration of beech tree species, but constant disturbance prevents this. Although the full extent to which feral pigs are damaging the New Zealand environment is unclear, pig rooting has the potential to impact long-term ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and the composition of plant species in forests. Feral pigs are also a significant predator of New Zealand’s native land snails (Powelliphanta spp.), earthworms can comprise a significant proportion of feral pig diet (from 10-26% dry weight), and it is believed that control of pigs is critical for the long-term survival of mainland populations of the threatened carabid Megadromus speciosus. Pigs also eat other native wildlife, such as ground nesting birds and their eggs, and lizards and frogs, although adverse effects have not been well quantified in New Zealand. In the U.S.A they have been identified as a predator of lizards and amphibians.\r\n\r\nThe ecological impacts of pigs have been more obvious and pronounced on offshore islands where there are less changes caused by humans. On the Auckland Islands, feral pigs caused severe damage to endemic large-leaved mega-herbs and to seabird colonies. Their densities there have now been greatly reduced through culling, but they continue to impact the tussock (Chionochloa antarctica) and if they continue unchecked, may eliminate it from low-altitude parts of the islands. On Aorangi Island (in the Poor Knights group), forest regeneration and re-colonisation by seabirds which used to live there was documented following the eradication of feral pigs.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nFeral pigs can damage pasture and crops and kill lambs and cast sheep. They have also been known to dig up and eat the roots of young trees on forestry plantations. These impacts are usually quite localised, and are worse on farms surrounded by native forest or scrub. Feral pigs can also carry bovine tuberculosis, but are thought to be spill-over hosts i.e. the disease will not persist in feral pig populations alone if the disease is eradicated from possums in the area (possums are considered a reservoir host).\r\n', 'Feral pigs can be controlled through hunting, trapping, and/or poisoning.

A national cat management strategy is being developed, which recognises these differences in its recommendations and the values people associate with cats.\r\n\r\nEcological impacts\r\nThe most preferred cat food item is rabbit, then small rodents.  Cats also hunt and kill native birds and skinks, including threatened species. Cats are known predators of many ground-feeding or ground-dwelling indigenous species including the threatened NZ dotterel, NZ pigeon, kakariki, black stilt, and kakapo. The decline of brown teal on Stewart Island coincided with an increase in cat numbers, and cats are considered to be the main predator of brown teal on Great Barrier Island. Cats contribute to heavy predation (up to 88.5% annually) of yellow-eyed penguin chicks.\r\n\r\nOn offshore islands, cats have been known to hunt indigenous species to extinction.  The most famous example is the Stephen’s Island wren which was both discovered and exterminated by the lighthouse keeper’s cat.  Extinction of saddlebacks from several islands occurred soon after cats were introduced.  Cats, in combination with rats, are thought to have accelerated the extinction of the Little Barrier snipe, and caused declines in populations of many other native species, including kakapo on Stewart Island.  Upon removal of cats from Little Barrier Island, stitchbird numbers increased six-fold and there were also increases in kakariki and robin numbers.\r\n\r\nCats are known to prey upon a variety of seabirds including Caspian tern, Cook’s petrel, black petrel, diving petrel, prions, grey-faced petrel, penguins, and black-winged petrels.  Much larger populations of bird species occur on adjacent cat-free islands compared to islands with cats.  Cats will also kill kiwi chicks, but not as often as stoats do. \r\n\r\nBoth long-tailed and short-tailed bat populations can be adversely affected by cats.  Lizard populations declined rapidly after the introduction of cats, and removal of cats from offshore or mainland islands can result in increased lizard numbers.  Many reptile species including the rare Otago, grand and scree skinks are eaten by cats, and mammalian predators such as cats are probably the major cause of massive range contraction of these species.  Eradication of cats alone may not result in increased native fauna; rats also need to be controlled.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nCats are the primary hosts of toxoplasmosis, estimated to infect almost 30 percent of all humans worldwide. Toxoplasmosis produces lifelong parasitic cysts in the brain, and though it is generally asymptomatic it has been linked to neurological impairments, depression, blindness and birth defects.  Most feral cats have fleas.  Various worm species including tapeworm and arrow-headed worm can be carried and spread by cats.  Cats can also carry bovine TB and cat leprosy.\r\n', 'Different approaches to managing cat populations are required, depending on whether feral or domestic cats are involved and the particular location and pest impacts.

Ferrets aren’t as common in large tracts of forest as stoats, but their ability to kill adult kiwi has become a problem in areas where forest is more fragmented such as in Northland. On the Otago Peninsula, ferrets have been shown to reduce the breeding success of yellow-eyed penguins, and throughout New Zealand they are known to attack the burrows of seabirds, and the nests of shorebirds. Video evidence has shown ferrets to be responsible for 18% of lethal attacks on ground nesting birds in braided rivers in the Mackenzie Basin; this includes attacks on the critically endangered black stilt. Ferrets can also eat large numbers of native skinks.\r\n\r\nOther impacts\r\nFerrets were introduced into New Zealand as a natural enemy of rabbits and therefore were expected to provide a benefit to the agriculture industry. Ferrets have reduced rabbit numbers in wetter lowland parts of New Zealand through predation on juveniles. However, in semi-arid areas such as Central Otago where rabbits have caused the most damage to pasture, ferrets are not able to reduce rabbit numbers.
